# SOLID Todo App

This Vue based application demonstrates the S.O.L.I.D programming principal within VueJS using TypeScript.

For more information please visit this Medium article, which helped to create this demo application: https://itnext.io/https-medium-com-manuustenko-how-to-avoid-solid-principles-violations-in-vue-js-application-1121a0df6197

## Things to try
1. In src/api/api.ts change the provider between fetch and axios. The application should not break
2. Change which component is displayed in Home.vue by commenting and uncommenting the two components within the `<TodoList></TodoList>` tags
3. Add your own API provider - perhaps use a different XMLHTTPRequest package?
4. Add a new way of displaying the todo items. A table perhaps?
